To address the memory management issues, ensure that objects are properly retained and released.  Use ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) or manual retain/release cycles to ensure that objects are deallocated when no longer needed. For the example with MyClass and OtherClass:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) OtherClass *otherClass;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // Release the otherClass instance if appropriate.
    self.otherClass = nil; 
}
@end
```

To prevent race conditions with nonatomic properties, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms. Atomic properties are a good start. For properties requiring more complex concurrency control, use locks (e.g., NSLock, @synchronized) to ensure thread safety:

```objectivec
@property (atomic, strong) NSMutableArray *myArray;

// Or using a lock:
- (void)updateArray:(id)object {
  @synchronized(self) { 
    [self.myArray addObject:object]; 
  }
}
```
These techniques help you avoid common memory and concurrency problems, thereby improving the reliability and stability of your Objective-C applications.
