In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to objects that are not properly retained or released. This often manifests as unexpected crashes or program instability due to memory leaks or dangling pointers. For example, consider a situation where a class 'MyClass' retains an instance of another class 'OtherClass'.  If 'MyClass' does not release 'OtherClass' when it's no longer needed, a memory leak occurs. Similarly, if a pointer to an object is used after the object has been deallocated (a dangling pointer), it can lead to crashes.

Another tricky aspect is the interaction between properties declared with `nonatomic` and concurrent access. If multiple threads access and modify such a property simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms (like locks or atomic operations), race conditions and data corruption can result.
